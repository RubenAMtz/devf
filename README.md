# Visitors exercise

We will be exploring a dataset corresponding to the classification of visitors vs non-visitors. The idea is to understand the underlying data and potentially find descriptors for the classifications. We will then proceed to show the creation of a model for the prediction of such class.

Please navigate to main.ipynb to explore the findings and steps followed. Happy coding ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤–.
